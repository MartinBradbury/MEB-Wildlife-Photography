                            wildlife and scenic
                            photographer.
                            I have always had an interest in wildlife,
                            especially when hiking in the Peak District and Lake District. I bought a camera in 2022 and
                            now
                            enjoy
                            weekends taking photographs of the world around
                            me and I want to share what I capture with you.
                            Being Lincoln based I have a short trip over to the Peaks where I am harnessing my
                            photography
                            skills and
                            proud of the natural photographs that capture
                            moments of peace, calmness and joy.
